# Deliberative Society Research

This project explores computational models and analyses of deliberative societies, focusing on how collective reasoning, argumentation, and decision-making processes can be simulated and studied using modern tools.

## Features

- Simulation of deliberative processes
- Analysis of argumentation structures
- Visualization of group decision dynamics

## Mathematical Model

The deliberative process can be represented as a graph $G = (V, E)$, where:
- $V$ is the set of arguments or agents,
- $E$ is the set of relations (such as support or attack) between them.

The evolution of opinions can be modeled by updating each agent's belief state $$b_i$$ at time $$t$$ according to:

$$ b_i^{(t+1)} = f(b_i^{(t)}, \sum_{j \in N(i)} w_{ij} b_j^{(t)})$$

where:
- $N(i)$ is the neighborhood of agent $i$,
- $w_{ij}$ is the influence weight from agent $j$ to $i$,
- $f$ is an update function (e.g., weighted average, bounded confidence).

### Tensor Representation

The model can be extended using tensors for more complex interactions:

- Let $$\mathbf{B}^{(t)} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$$ be the vector of all agents' beliefs at time $$t$$.
- Let $$\mathbf{W} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$$ be the influence weight matrix, where $$W_{ij} = w_{ij}$$.
- The update rule in tensor notation:

$$
\mathbf{B}^{(t+1)} = f\left(\mathbf{B}^{(t)}, \mathbf{W} \mathbf{B}^{(t)}\right)
$$

- For higher-order interactions (e.g., triadic influence), a third-order tensor $$\mathcal{T} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n \times n}$$ can be used:

$$
B_i^{(t+1)} = f\left(B_i^{(t)}, \sum_{j,k} \mathcal{T}_{ijk} B_j^{(t)} B_k^{(t)}\right)
$$
